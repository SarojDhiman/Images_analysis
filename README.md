Multilingual Model Testing: Evaluating Performance Across Five Languages

Introduction:
In the realm of image analysis, understanding text content is crucial for accurate interpretation and decision-making. However, the diversity of languages poses a significant challenge, necessitating the development of multilingual models. In this study, we aim to assess the effectiveness of our model across five languages: Hindi, English, Tamil, Kannada, and Romanised Hindi.

Purpose:
The primary objective of this testing endeavour is to gauge the performance of our model in accurately translating text from images in the aforementioned languages. By evaluating its efficacy across diverse linguistic contexts, we can ascertain its potential utility in real-world applications such as image captioning, document analysis, and sentiment analysis.

Methodology:

Data Collection: We curated a diverse dataset comprising images containing textual content in Hindi, English, Tamil, Kannada, and Bengali languages.
Model Training: Our multilingual model was trained using state-of-the-art techniques, leveraging advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision.
Testing Procedure: Images from the dataset were processed through our model, which extracted and translated the text present in each image.
Evaluation Metrics: The performance of the model was evaluated based on multiple criteria, including translation accuracy, sentiment analysis, and keyword extraction.
Results:

Translated Text: The text extracted from images in each language was translated into the corresponding target language.
Predicted Sentiment: Sentiment analysis was conducted to determine the emotional tone conveyed by the text.
Sentiment Probabilities: Probabilities associated with each sentiment category (positive, negative, neutral) were calculated to gauge the model's confidence.
Extracted Keywords: Key terms and phrases were identified within the translated text to provide insights into the main themes.
Identified Sections: The model identified specific sections of text within the images, facilitating targeted analysis and understanding.
